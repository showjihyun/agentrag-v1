# Agentic RAG System - Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that combines intelligent document retrieval with multi-agent reasoning to provide accurate, contextual responses to user queries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload and manage documents, so that I can query information from my document collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF, DOCX, TXT, PPT, PPTX, HWP, HWPX, or MD file THEN the system SHALL process and index the document
2. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text, tables, and images
3. WHEN a document is processed THEN the system SHALL chunk the content semantically
4. WHEN a document is indexed THEN the system SHALL store embeddings in Milvus
5. IF a user owns a document THEN the user SHALL be able to view, search, and delete it
6. WHEN a user deletes a document THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data from storage

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Query Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about my documents, so that I can quickly find relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a query THEN the system SHALL analyze query complexity
2. IF the query is simple THEN the system SHALL use fast mode processing
3. IF the query is moderate THEN the system SHALL use balanced mode processing
4. IF the query is complex THEN the system SHALL use deep mode processing
5. WHEN processing a query THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant document chunks
6. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL cite source documents
7. WHEN responding THEN the system SHALL stream the response in real-time

### Requirement 3: Multi-Agent Reasoning

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use intelligent reasoning, so that I receive accurate and well-thought-out answers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a query THEN the Aggregator Agent SHALL coordinate specialized agents
2. WHEN reasoning THEN the system SHALL use ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern
3. WHEN planning THEN the system SHALL use Chain of Thought decomposition
4. WHEN retrieving information THEN the Vector Search Agent SHALL query Milvus
5. IF additional data is needed THEN the Local Data Agent SHALL access file systems
6. IF web information is needed THEN the Web Search Agent SHALL perform searches
7. WHEN agents complete tasks THEN the Aggregator SHALL synthesize results

### Requirement 4: Memory Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our conversation, so that I can have contextual follow-up discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation starts THEN the system SHALL create a session in Redis
2. WHEN messages are exchanged THEN the system SHALL store them in Short-Term Memory
3. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL consolidate learnings to Long-Term Memory
4. WHEN a user returns THEN the system SHALL load conversation history
5. IF patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL store them in LTM for future use
6. WHEN memory is full THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retention policies

### Requirement 5: User Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure access to my documents, so that my data remains private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL issue a JWT token
3. WHEN accessing documents THEN the system SHALL verify ownership
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL allow guest access with limitations
5. WHEN a token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
6. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the system SHALL validate permissions

### Requirement 6: Multimodal Document Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand images and tables in documents, so that I can query visual content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document contains images THEN the system SHALL extract and process them
2. WHEN a document contains tables THEN the system SHALL extract structured data
3. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL use ColPali for visual embeddings
4. WHEN querying images THEN the system SHALL perform multimodal similarity search
5. IF a table is found THEN the system SHALL preserve its structure
6. WHEN responding about visual content THEN the system SHALL reference the source

### Requirement 7: Adaptive Query Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically choose the best processing method, so that I get optimal results efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query is received THEN the system SHALL analyze its complexity
2. IF complexity is low THEN the system SHALL route to fast mode
3. IF complexity is medium THEN the system SHALL route to balanced mode
4. IF complexity is high THEN the system SHALL route to deep mode
5. WHEN routing THEN the system SHALL consider query patterns from history
6. WHEN processing THEN the system SHALL optimize for speed vs. quality trade-offs

### Requirement 8: Real-Time Streaming

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see responses as they're generated, so that I know the system is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a response THEN the system SHALL stream tokens in real-time
2. WHEN agents reason THEN the system SHALL stream reasoning steps
3. WHEN retrieving documents THEN the system SHALL stream source citations
4. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL stream error information
5. WHEN streaming THEN the system SHALL use Server-Sent Events (SSE)
6. WHEN the response is complete THEN the system SHALL send a completion signal

### Requirement 9: Performance & Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to handle multiple users efficiently, so that performance remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users query simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests
2. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 5 seconds
3. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL serve repeated queries from cache
4. IF resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling
6. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics

### Requirement 10: Error Handling & Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message
2. IF a document upload fails THEN the system SHALL explain why
3. IF a query fails THEN the system SHALL suggest alternatives
4. WHEN services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade
5. IF LLM calls timeout THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
6. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL include context for debugging
