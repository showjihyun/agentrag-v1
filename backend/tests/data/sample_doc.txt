Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing it to "learn" from large amounts of data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

Applications of AI include:
- Computer vision and image recognition
- Speech recognition and natural language processing
- Autonomous vehicles and robotics
- Healthcare diagnostics and drug discovery
- Financial trading and fraud detection
- Recommendation systems and personalization
